This site has links to tutorials and examples used during in-person workshops for teaching how to use plenoptic, a python library for model-based synthesis of perceptual stimuli. Unless otherwise noted, these materials are independent of each other, and are intended as an introduction to the package.

For more details about what plenoptic is, go to our [home page](https://plenoptic.org).
